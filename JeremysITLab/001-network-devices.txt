network - a set of nodes sharing resources
nodes -> client, server, router, switch, firewall

clients and servers are sometimes called endhosts or endpoints (confusing lol)


router -> forwards traffic BETWEEN networks
switch -> forwards traffic WITHIN network

routers will have fewer network interfaces than switches

LAN -> local area network. Something that all your computers in the same location are connected to.

computer -> switch -> router -> internet -> router -> switch -> computer


firewall - a thing for security and monitoring traffic
 - 2 types: hardware and software. 
 - The hardware firewall is sometimes called a network firewall. 
 - A software firewall is sometimes called a host-based firewall

network firewall -> hardware firewall for filtering traffic into a network
host-based firewall -> a software firewall for filtering traffic into a machine (e.g. your PC)

firewalls can be within or without (outside) of a LAN. 
next-generation firewall -> a firewall with extra filtering capabilities
